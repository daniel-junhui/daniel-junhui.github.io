This blog aims to share and document some of the problems I encountered in my studies, and you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/niujunhui).

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science. My undergraduate degree is not in computer science, and the School of Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University is a terrible college in which I wasted four years of my youth. I highly do not recommend studying traditional engineering.

I am a student of Chinese nationality and I hope that life will get better for the Chinese people, no matter what political party leads, no matter what ideology. But it doesn't look like it will get better in recent years.
